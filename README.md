# Breeze

A basic messaging app built with Express.

## Installation/Setting up

- Clone the repo.
- Put the host and port in the config.json file.
- Set up databases and run using `npm run first_run`.
- Access the app at the URL you specified in config.json.

You can run it using `npm run start` after the first run.

## Using

- Create an account (`<domain>/signup`)
- You will be redirected to the messaging page, where you can send messages to other users.
- If you are not in any groups (icons on the left side) create one using the `+` button in the top left corner.
- Enter the group name and members (separated by commas) and click `Create`.
- Refresh the page.
- You can now send messages to the group.
- If you reload the page, you will lose the message history, except for the latest message.
